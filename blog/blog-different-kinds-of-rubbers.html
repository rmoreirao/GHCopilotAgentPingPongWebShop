        <h1>The Different Kinds of Rubbers</h1>
        <p>An overview of the various types of rubbers used in table tennis.</p>
        <article>
            <h2>Inverted (Smooth) Rubbers</h2>
            <p>The most common type of rubber, featuring a smooth surface with pimples facing inward. These rubbers excel at generating spin and are versatile for both attack and defense. Popular among modern players for their consistency and control.</p>
            
            <h2>Short Pips</h2>
            <p>Characterized by short, outward-facing pimples, these rubbers reduce the opponent's spin effect. They're excellent for blocking and hitting, making them popular among close-to-table attacking players.</p>
            
            <h2>Long Pips</h2>
            <p>Featuring longer outward-facing pimples, these rubbers are primarily defensive tools. They can reverse and disrupt incoming spin, making them challenging for opponents to read and predict.</p>
            
            <h2>Anti-Spin</h2>
            <p>Specially designed to nullify spin, these rubbers have very low friction surfaces. They're particularly effective for defensive players who want to return heavy topspin with minimal spin.</p>
