        <h1>History of Table Tennis</h1>
        <p>A brief history of how table tennis evolved over the years.</p>
        <article>
            <h2>Origins in Victorian England</h2>
            <p>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong, originated in Victorian England as an after-dinner parlor game. Upper-class Victorians would use books as nets, rounded corks from champagne bottles as balls, and cigar box lids as rackets.</p>
            
            <h2>Evolution into a Sport</h2>
            <p>In the early 1900s, the game began to evolve into a proper sport. The introduction of celluloid balls in 1901 marked a significant improvement over the earlier cork and rubber balls. E.C. Goode's invention of pimpled rubber in 1902 revolutionized the game by enabling players to put spin on the ball.</p>
            
            <h2>Modern Era</h2>
            <p>Today, table tennis is an Olympic sport known for its incredible speed and skill requirements. Modern equipment uses sophisticated materials and designs, with professional players carefully selecting their equipment to match their playing style.</p>
