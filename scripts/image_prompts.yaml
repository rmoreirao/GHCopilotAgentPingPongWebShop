    prompt: "Create a minimalist and professional logo design for 'Ping Pong Shop' featuring a stylized table tennis paddle and ball. The design should use the color #0077B6 (professional blue) as the primary color, with white (#F8F9FA) for contrast, and subtle accents in #2D6A4F (green). The paddle should be depicted in a clean, modern geometric style, positioned at a slight angle with a small ball nearby. The text 'PING PONG SHOP' should be in a modern sans-serif font, arranged either below or beside the icon. The overall design should convey reliability and professionalism while being easily recognizable at different sizes. The background should be transparent."

    prompt: "Create a dynamic and professional photograph of a table tennis match in action. Show a player executing a powerful forehand shot with perfect form, captured at the moment of impact. The scene should be dramatically lit with professional sports lighting, creating a sense of intensity and motion. The player should be wearing professional attire in blue (#0077B6) and white (#F8F9FA). The background should show a slightly blurred modern sports facility with subtle green (#2D6A4F) accents. The composition should convey both the speed and precision of professional table tennis while maintaining a clean, premium aesthetic."
